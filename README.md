# API-to-do-list
This is a project for the 5th Semester of college, where we are required to create a web application with CRUD functionality. In our project, we will develop a 'To-Do List' application, where users can log in, create tasks, and manage their progress, moving them between 'To Do,' 'In Progress,' and 'Completed' statuses."
